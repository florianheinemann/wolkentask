==========

[wolkentask](https://www.wolkentask.com) is a no-nonsense online editor for to-do lists. Instead of strong the to-do lists in cryptic file formats, wolkentasks stores them as plain text Markdown files directly on your Dropbox.

To-dos can be viewed and amended on desktops, smartphones, and tablets and thanks to Dropbox everything stays synchronized. Importing to-do files is as simple as droping an text file into your Dropbox account and wolkentask will automatically recognize it as a to-do file.
